# Cas-FNE

This repository contains an implementation for the paper "Cas-FNE: Cascaded Face Normal Estimation".


Although recent approaches to face normal estimation have achieved promising results, their effectiveness heavily depends on large-scale paired data for training. This paper concentrates on relieving this requirement via developing a coarse-to-fine normal estimator. Concretely, our method first trains a neat model from a small dataset to produce coarse face normals that perform as guidance (called exemplars) for the following refinement. A self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, thus remedying severe local artifacts left in estimated coarse facial normals. Then, a refinement network is customized for the sake of mapping input face images together with corresponding exemplars to fine-grained high-quality facial normals. Such a logical function split can significantly cut the requirement of massive paired data and computational resource.
